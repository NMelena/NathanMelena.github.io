									<h2>What we can learn about <br />

									<p>In this project we take raw data from the Guttmacher Institute analyze it with SQL, and display what we have found through Tableau.  And use all of that to gleam some insights as to how the recent supreme court decision will affect women across the country.</p>

									<p>Each data visualization tells us something different about abortions in America.  For example, the map shows us that four states, Georgia, North Carolina,
										 Kansas, and Illinois are states that women from other states flock to for abortions.  Meaning that efforts should be made to keep the abortion laws in 
										 those states as liberal as possible not only for the women in those states, but also for the women who use those states as a healthcare safe haven. The 
										 scatter plot shows a negative correlation between the percent of women who take birth control and the rate of abortions.  This information could be used 
										 by more conservative legislators to back policies that supply contraceptives to more women, achieving their goal of less abortions.  The bar graph shows 
										 us states where the rate of abortions is higher, indicating states that are in more need of liberal abortion laws.  And finally, the tree map shows how 
										 much of the total abortions done in the America are done in each state, which is another indicator of key states to make sure abortion laws are liberal in.
										<br><br>Although this data is useful and important, there are some drawbacks that you should be aware of.  The first and most obvious is that the scatter 
										plot does not have data for all 50 states.  The reason for this is the Guttmacher Institute was unable to collect data on contraceptive use in 12 states.
										 Another drawback of the data, is that the two columns used to calculate the flow of women for the map was sourced by the Guttmacher Institute from two 
										 different sources with slightly different totals, causing there to be 1510 more women accounted for in the “state where the abortion occurred column.”  
										 That means there is slightly more flow-in than flow-out on the map. Even keeping those drawbacks in mind, this data gives us valuable information on 
										 abortions in the United States. </p>
